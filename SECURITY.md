# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Aleph is a fast-moving project, developed through grant funding. We thus cannot provide specific 
long-term support releases. Instead, we advise all implementors of the software to keep their
installations up to date as much as they can.

Please refer to our [Support Policy](SUPPORT.md) for more information about supported Aleph versions.

## Reporting security vulnerabilities

In order to report a security vulnerability, please contact the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), the core maintainer of Aleph. For details, please refer to [OCCRP’s Responsible Disclosure Policy](https://www.occrp.org/en/responsible-disclosure).
