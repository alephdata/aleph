.. epigraph::

  Truth cannot penetrate a closed mind. If all places in the universe are in
  the Aleph, then all stars, all lamps, all sources of light are in it, too.

  -- `The Aleph <http://www.phinnweb.org/links/literature/borges/aleph.html>`_,
  Jorge Luis Borges

**Aleph** is a tool for indexing large amounts of both documents (PDF, Word,
HTML) and structured (CSV, XLS, SQL) data for easy browsing and search. It is
built with investigative reporting as a primary use case. Aleph allows
cross-referencing mentions of well-known entities (such as people and
companies) against watchlists, e.g. from prior research or public datasets.

For further details on the software, how to use it, install it or manage data
imports, please check the documentation at:
