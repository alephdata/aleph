.. epigraph::

  Truth cannot penetrate a closed mind. If all places in the universe are in
  the Aleph, then all stars, all lamps, all sources of light are in it, too.

   :alt: Build Status

**Aleph** is a tool for indexing large amounts of both documents (PDF, Word,
HTML) and structured (CSV, XLS, SQL) data for easy browsing and search. It is
built with investigative reporting as a primary use case. Aleph allows
cross-referencing mentions of well-known entities (such as people and
companies) against watchlists, e.g. from prior research or public datasets.

Here's some key features:

* Web-based search across large document and data sets.
* Imports many file formats, including popular office formats, spreadsheets,
  email and zipped archives. Processing includes optical character recognition,
  language and encoding detection and named entity extraction.
* Load structured entity graph data from databases and CSV files. This allows
  navigation of complex datasets like companies registries, sanctions lists or
  procurement data. Import tools for `OpenSanctions <http://opensanctions.org/>`_.
  are included.
* Receive notifications for new search matches with a personal watchlist.
* OAuth authorization and access control on a per-source and per-watchlist
  basis.
