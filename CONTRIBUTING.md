# How to Contribute

Welcome friend.

If you are reading this document then we're assuming you are looking for ways that you can help contribute to the devlopment of Aleph. This document has been created to serve as a guide to help you navigate your way to your first contribution. Please read on to learn more.

Aleph is an open source project, and is under active development. We are always striving to make this project as easy, open, and transparent as possible for external contributors but we've got a long way to go. This document seeks to outline the best way to get started with contributing to Aleph, and will hopefully answer some of the questions that you may have.

## Code of Conduct

The Aleph team have adopted the [contributor covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) as the basis for its code of conduct and we expect all contributors to adhere to it. Please take some time to read the [code of conduct](https://github.com/alephdata/aleph/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand what is expected of you and what will happen if you do something which is not tolerated.

## Working on issues

### Find the right task

If this is your first time working on Aleph then it's probably a good idea to pick something easy to work on. To do this you can filter our open issues by label and look for 'low hanging fruit', these issues should not be too challenging to work on but will certainly help benefit the community and the product.

For more experienced developers we have a range of different labels that we use to try and compartmentalize our issues. To check the full list of labels [check the labels page in github](https://github.com/alephdata/aleph/labels).

### Create a fork and a branch

All new development work needs to happen on a branch. If this is your first time, you'll not have the ability to create branches directly from Aleph so will need to fork the repo. Once you've done this create an issue branch and commit all you changes to this.

### Pull request and Code review

### Merge and release

## Versioning

The Aleph team try to follow the concepts of semantic versioning. This means that we'll release patch versions for bugfixes, minor versions for new features and non breaking changes to existing functionality and major versions for large features and breaking changes.

All significant changes are recorded in our [changelog file](https://github.com/alephdata/docs/blob/master/developers/changelog.md)

## Branches

Aleph uses two main branches. The **develop** branch is for any new work that needs to be merged into Aleph. If you have bugfixes, features, or any other changes you should open a pull request to the **develop** branch. As part of our release process we will merge all changes made to develop into the main branch just before a new release of the product. The main branch is designated as stable and should not be committed to directly.

## Bugs and Features

We use github issues for all our public facing work. We try to keep a close eye on this, to respond to questions, and to make it clear when we pick up and start working on the issues that we raise.

### Known issues

### Stale issues

## How to get support

If you're trying to install Aleph and need help, or if you are running Aleph and are experiencing problems then please:

1. Read the Aleph Support Policy in `SUPPORT.md` and understand under what
   rules we provide support to others. If you feel you fall within that
   group, please [get in touch](https://docs.alephdata.org/get-in-touch).

2. Make sure you've read the documentation (https://docs.alephdata.org),
   especially the technical troubleshooting sections.

3. Only once you're **certain that the problem you are seeing is a bug**
   (and not a local configuration issue), file a report on GitHub for it.

Thanks very much, we look forward to working with you!
