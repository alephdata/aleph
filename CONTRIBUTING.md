# How to Contribute

Aleph is an open source project, and is under active development. We are always striving to make this project as easy, open, and transparent as possible for external contributors but we've got a long way to go. This document seeks to outline the best way to get started with contributing to Aleph, and will hopefully answer some of the questions that you may have.

## Code of Conduct

The Aleph team have adopted the [contributor covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) as the basis for its code of conduct and we expect all contributors to adhere to it. Please take some time to read the [code of conduct](https://github.com/alephdata/aleph/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand what is expected of you and what will happen if you do something which is not tolerated.

## Open source development

Please note that **we use GitHub issues to track software defects and enhancements**.

## Versioning

The Aleph team try to follow the concepts of semantic versioning. This means that we'll release patch versions for bugfixes, minor versions for new features and non breaking changes to existing functionality and major versions for large features and breaking changes.

## How to get support

If you're trying to install Aleph and need help, or if you are running Aleph and are experiencing problems then please:

1. Read the Aleph Support Policy in `SUPPORT.md` and understand under what
   rules we provide support to others. If you feel you fall within that
   group, please [get in touch](https://docs.alephdata.org/get-in-touch).

2. Make sure you've read the documentation (https://docs.alephdata.org),
   especially the technical troubleshooting sections.

3. Only once you're **certain that the problem you are seeing is a bug**
   (and not a local configuration issue), file a report on GitHub for it.

Thanks very much, we look forward to working with you!
