# How to navigate the Aleph homepage
<p class="lead">Welcome to the Aleph homepage! The homepage appears once you log in to your Aleph account. It is divided into separate sections, each with its own functionality. On this page, you will learn more more about the different sections.</p>

### Search box
This is the general search box. All terms that are typed in the search box will result in Aleph searching for information across all datasets which you have access to. The gray symbol to the right of the search box represents the [advanced search feature](/users/search/advanced).

### Datasets
By clicking on this button, you can view all the datasets accessible for  your account.

### Investigations
In this section, you can create your own investigation workspace to upload documents, cross-reference lists of names and persons and build relationship diagrams, among other functionalities. By default, these are private workspaces, i.e., associated with your account. However, you can share your research with other users who have an Aleph account.

### Bookmarks
In this section, you can view which documents you bookmarked throughout your search.

### About
In this section, you are able to find out more about the Aleph project, our acceptable use terms, frequently asked questions, and terms of use.

### Account settings
By clicking your profile name in the upper right-hand corner, you can view notifications, alerts, exports, investigations, network diagrams, timelines, lists, settings, system status, and the option to sign out. See side menu explanation below for more information.

## Side menu
Similar to the account settings option available in the upper right-hand corner of your Aleph screen, the left-hand side menu provides similar functionality.

#### Notifications
By default, when on the homepage, you will be able to see updates made to the datasets available to you.

#### Alerts
You can save the names of people, e-mails, and/or companies and ask Aleph to notify you if the term is mentioned in new datasets that are uploaded or in updated datasets. These alerts are private to you and are only accessible to the profile that generates them. See the Creating alerts section of this user guide for more information on alerts.

#### Exports
The results of the searches that you perform in Aleph can be downloaded. This button will display the exports generated by you.

#### Network diagrams
Network diagrams let you illustrate webs of people, companies, bank accounts and other objects in a visual way. See [Drawing network diagrams](/users/investigations/network-diagrams) for more information on network diagrams.

#### Timelines
Timelines allow you to visualize events by date.

{/* TODO Link to timelines documentation article */}

#### Lists
{/*TODO Check if we should link to the xref guide*/}
Shows the current number of lists that you have created. Lists let you organize and group related entities of interest. See [Uploading lists to cross-reference your data against other datasets](/users/investigations/cross-referencing) for more information on lists.
