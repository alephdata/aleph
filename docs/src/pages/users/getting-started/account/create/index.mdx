## Set up a mobile authenticator (2FA)

<Steps>
  <Step>
    To keep your account secure, we require that you set up a mobile authenticator (sometimes also referred to as "2FA"). A mobile authenticator is an app that you install on your smartphone. It is required in addition to your email address and password when you log in. We recommend the **Google Authenticator** app, but you can also use a different app if you prefer. You can download the Google Authenticator app [for iOS from the Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/google-authenticator/id388497605) or [for Android from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    In the Google Authenticator app, click on <AnnotationRef>Add a code</AnnotationRef>, then select <AnnotationRef>Scan a QR code</AnnotationRef>.

    <Annotations>
      <Image
        src="/assets/pages/users/getting-started/account/google-authenticator-setup.png"
        alt="Two smartphone screens showing the Google Authenticator app. The first screen has a button labeled 'Add a code'. The second screen has the title 'Add an authenticator code' and two options: 'Scan a QR code' and 'Enter a setup key'."
      />
      <Annotation
        x="15.25%"
        y="57%"
        width="25.5%"
        height="7.75%"
      />
      <Annotation
        x="60%"
        y="46%"
        width="13.5%"
        height="6%"
      />
    </Annotations>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Use the Google Authenticator app on your phone to scan the <AnnotationRef>QR code</AnnotationRef> displayed on your computer screen.

    <Annotations>
      <Image
        src="/assets/pages/users/getting-started/account/keycloak-2fa-setup.png"
        alt="A screenshot of the 'Mobile Authenticator Setup' page. The page shows a QR code and a form with an input labelled 'One-time code'."
      />
      <Annotation
        x="31.5%"
        y="42.75%"
        width="14.25%"
        height="14.25%"
      />
    </Annotations>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    The Google Authenticator app on your phone now displays a six-digit code. Enter this code in the <AnnotationRef>One-time code</AnnotationRef> field on your computer and click the **Submit** button to complete the mobile authenticator setup.

    In the <AnnotationRef>Device name</AnnotationRef> field, you can optionally provide a name for the device you installed the Google Authenticator app on. For example, if you installed the Google Authenticator app on an iPhone, you could enter "iPhone" as the device name, but you can also chose any other name.

## Set a password

    />
  </Step>

  <Step>Finally, you will receive another email with the subject line **Verify email**. Click on the link in the email to verify your email address.</Step>
