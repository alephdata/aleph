## When I enter the code from my 2FA app to log in to Aleph, it says it is incorrect. I tried several times and it did not work. What should I do?

If you are receiving an error message after putting in your one time password, this issue is most likely caused by the current time on your phone or laptop. Follow the troubleshooting steps below:

### Using macOS?

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Click on the Apple logo in the upper left-hand corner and select **System preferences** from the dropdown menu. In the System Preferences, go to **Date and Time**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Click the **lock icon** in the bottom left-hand corner of the window, then enter your administrator password to unlock the lock. (The settings are dimmed when locked).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    In the **Date and Time** pane, make sure that **Set date and time automatically** is selected and your Mac is connected to the internet. Your Mac can then get the current date and time from the network time server selected in the adjacent menu.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Using Windows?

<Steps>
  <Step>
    To set your time and time zone in Windows 10, go to **Start** ▶ **Settings** ▶ **Time & language** ▶ **Date & time**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Turn on **Set time automatically** and **Set time zone automatically**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Using an iPhone?

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Go to **Settings** ▶ **General** ▶ **Date and Time**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Turn on **Set Automatically**. The iPhone now gets the correct time over the network and updates it for the timezone you are in. Some networks don't support network time, so in some countries or regions, an iPhone may not be able to automatically determine the local time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Using Android?

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Go to **Settings** and click on **Date and Time**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Click on **Automatic**. If this option is turned off, check that the correct **Date**, **Time**, and **Time zone** are selected.
  </Step>
</Steps>
