# Data commons

<p class="lead">
  Our data commons helps new users of the aleph tools to easily get access to some key open datasets that might be helpful in building an investigative archive.
</p>

The data below is available in [Follow the Money](/developers/followthemoney/) format, suitable for processing using [ftm](/developers/followthemoney/ftm) and [alephclient](/developers/alephclient) and direct import into Aleph.

## OpenSanctions

Sanctions lists, databases of politicians and criminal figures can be a good way to find leads within other data, using [cross-referencing](/guide/building-out-your-investigation/cross-referencing). The [OpenSanctions](http://opensanctions.org) project generates consolidated sanctions data from multiple sources, and provides the entries as Follow the Money \(FtM\) data.

**See: [https://opensanctions.org**](https://opensanctions.org)**

## ICIJ OffshoreLeaks

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists has published data from its major investigations, including the Offshore Leaks \(2013\), Panama Papers \(2016\) and Paradise Papers \(2017\).

We've developed a set of importers that convert this data to FollowTheMoney format, available here: [https://github.com/alephdata/offshoreleaks](https://github.com/alephdata/offshoreleaks)
