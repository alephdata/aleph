# How To Extend the Ingest Pipeline

<p class="lead">By default, Aleph’s ingest pipeline already does quite a few things for you, for example text recognition or named entity extraction. But if you need something that Aleph doesn’t currently support, you can also extend the ingest pipeline with custom processing stages. This guide explains how to implement a custom processing stage.</p>

## Conceptual overview

All processing in Aleph is coordinated via a set of queues kept in redis, an in-memory data store. When a document is processed, the instruction to handle it is posted on that queue, which is read by multiple independent services. Each service can subscribe to one or many *stages* in order to receive tasks, e.g. the `ingest` stage (which extracts text from a file), the `analyze` stage (which performs NER and language detection) and finally the `index` stage (which adds the document to Aleph’s search index).

A new stage can be added to this pipeline at runtime, either by extending the code of the `worker` service, the `ingest-file` service, or by adding a new service that stands on its own. The last option is the cleanest, and can be based on `servicelayer`, the Python package that implements the queue and worker code.

## Developing the service

An example implementation of a `servicelayer`-based processing service is available in [this repository](https://github.com/alephdata/translate-service). The code should be short enough to study in full, especially the worker module.

  To run the example service, you will need to create a service account JSON key with permission to use the Google Cloud Translation API, and configure both the project ID and the path for the service account file.

Once you have added the service to the compose configuration, you can include the stage in the pipeline by adjusting the `ALEPH_INGEST_PIPELINE` configuration option:

```
ALEPH_INGEST_PIPELINE=analyze:translate
```

You may need to restart Aleph in order for the changes to take effect.
