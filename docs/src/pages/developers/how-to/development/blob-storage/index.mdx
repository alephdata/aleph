# How to Set Up a Storage Provider for Development

<p class="lead">When making changes to file storage in Aleph, it can be helpful to test changes against a real storage provider. This guide describes how to run the MinIO object storage provider in your local development environment and how to configure Aleph accordingly.</p>

<Callout theme="danger">This guide describes how to set up MinIO in a development environment. If you want to configure a production Aleph instance to use a storage provider, please refer to [our operations guide](/developers/how-to/operations/blob-storage).</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Run the following command to start a single-node MinIO instance for development:

    ```bash
    docker run -p "9000:9000" -p "9001:9001" quay.io/minio/minio minio server --console-address :9001 /mnt/data
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    You can access the MinIO console at `http://localhost:9001`. Log in using the default credentials `minioadmin`/`minioadmin`.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    In order to create a new bucket, click on "Buckets" in the sidebar, then click on "Create Bucket".
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Enter `aleph-archive` as the bucket name and click on "Create Bucket".
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Set the following Aleph configuration options:

| Configuration option | Value |
| --- | --- |
| ARCHIVE_TYPE | s3 |
| ARCHIVE_BUCKET | aleph-archive |
| ARCHIVE_ENDPOINT_URL | http://host.docker.internal:9000 |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | minioadmin |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | minioadmin |
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Restart Aleph.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  Usually, Docker Desktop automatically adds an entry in `/etc/hosts` to resolve `host.docker.internal`. If `host.docker.internal` canâ€™t be resolved, you may need to manually add an entry to `/etc/hosts`:

  ```
  127.0.0.1 host.docker.internal
  ```
