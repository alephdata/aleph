# How To Upgrade to a New Version

<p class="lead">Aleph is under active development. We release new Aleph versions with bugfixes, stability improvements, and new features. We recommend that you always run a recent version of Aleph. This guide describes how to upgrade a production Aleph instance to a new version.</p>

<Callout>
  Do you want to upgrade your local development environment? Follow the steps in the [Getting Started](/developers/getting-started/development-environment#upgrade-to-a-new-version) section.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Before you upgrade to a new Aleph version, [create a backup](/developers/how-to/operations/backups) of all your data. Make sure that you’re backup process is reliable and that you are able to successfully restore data from your backups.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    We publish new releases on our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/alephdata/aleph/releases/). In some cases, new Aleph versions may include breaking changes that include additional, manual steps in order to upgrade. We will add a warning to the release notes in such cases, so make sure you read and understand the release notes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Docker Compose

If you have deployed Aleph using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Review changes to the `docker-compose.yml` of the Aleph version you want to upgrade to. Make sure to sure what these changes mean, then apply the changes to your custom `docker-compose.yml` configuration file. This includes changing the Aleph version number in `docker-compose.yml` to the version you’d like to upgrade to.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Pull new versions of the container images:

    ```bash
    docker compose pull --parallel
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Stop all containers:

    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Start all services:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d redis postgres elasticsearch
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Wait for a minute or two until all services have started. Then run database migrations:

    ```bash
    docker compose run --rm shell aleph upgrade
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Finally, start all containers:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Kubernetes

If you have deployed Aleph using Kubernetes, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    For every Aleph release, we also publish a new version of the Aleph Helm chart. Make sure you [pull the corresponding version](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_pull/) of the Aleph Helm chart.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    [Upgrade the Helm release](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/) to the latest version. This will automatically run database migrations.
