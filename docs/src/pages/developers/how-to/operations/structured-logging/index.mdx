# How To Enable Structured Logging

<p class="lead">By default, Aleph emits logs in a format thatâ€™s easy to read for humans. However, you can also configure Aleph to emit logs in JSON format. This is especially useful if you use a centralized log aggregation service, as it provides additional context and allow you to filter logs based on structured data.</p>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Set the `LOG_FORMAT` configuration option to `JSON`.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Restart Aleph.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    The Aleph API, Aleph workers, and ingest-file logs will now emit logs in JSON format, with additional context. For example, many logs will include the ID of the collection or job the log is related to:

```json
{
  "logger": "aleph.worker",
  "timestamp": "2024-06-19 09:35:30.996352",
  "job_id": "4:b20c3421-74dd-468f-bf21-a5957ef01d37",
  "stage": "index",
  "start_time": 1718789730.9948978,
  "v": "3.17.0",
  "dataset": "2",
  "retry": 0,
  "trace_id": "11239b1b-b4e5-45d5-b6de-ad37679c4bb5",
  "message": "Task [2]: index (started)",
  "severity": "INFO",
}
```
  </Step>
</Steps>
