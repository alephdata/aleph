# FollowTheMoney

<p class="lead">Aleph is built on top of FollowTheMoney, a data model for the most common entity and relationship types used in anti-corruption reporting. Aleph allows users to browse, import, and export data in the FollowTheMoney data format. This page explains key concepts of FollowTheMoney.</p>

## Entities and schemata

FollowTheMoney defines entity types commonly used in anti-corruption reporting, including [people](https://followthemoney.tech/explorer/schemata/Person/), [companies](https://followthemoney.tech/explorer/schemata/Company/), [assets](https://followthemoney.tech/explorer/schemata/Asset/), [addresses](https://followthemoney.tech/explorer/schemata/Address/), etc. In fact, even the files you upload to Aleph are modelled as entities (for example, there are entities representing [spreadsheets](https://followthemoney.tech/explorer/schemata/Workbook/), [emails](https://followthemoney.tech/explorer/schemata/Email/), and other types of files). An entity can also represent a relationship between other entities, such as a payment or an ownership of a company.

Entity types are also called **entity schemata**.

## Properties

Every entity schema defines a set of properties. For example, the [Person](https://followthemoney.tech/explorer/schemata/Person/) schema has a `nationality` property while the [Company](https://followthemoney.tech/explorer/schemata/Company/) schema has a `jurisdiction` property. Both properties, however, have the same property type, [country](https://followthemoney.tech/explorer/types/country/).

## References

There are many different property types, including types for [strings](https://followthemoney.tech/explorer/types/string/), [dates](https://followthemoney.tech/explorer/types/date/) or [identifiers](https://followthemoney.tech/explorer/types/identifier/). There is also a special entity property type which allows entities to reference other entities. For example, the Passport schema has a `holder` property that references another entity:

<Mermaid
  content={`
    graph LR
      passport("Passport") -- "holder" --> holder("Person")
  `}
/>

This also allows modelling more complex relationships:

<Mermaid
  content={`
    graph TB
      acme("ACME, Inc.")
      john("John Doe")
      directorship("Directorship\nStart date: 1996-01-24\nEnd date: 2001-04-01")
      directorship -- "director" --> john
      directorship -- "organization" --> acme
  `}
/>

## JSON

Entities are often serialized as JSON snippets. For example, the example in the section above could be represented as follows:

```json
{
  "id": "acme",
  "schema": "Company",
  "properties": {
    "name": ["ACME, Inc."],
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "id": "john",
  "schema": "Person",
  "properties": {
    "name": ["John Doe"],
  },
}
```

```json
{
  "id": "john-acme",
  "schema": "Directorship",
  "properties": {
    "director": ["john"],
    "organization": ["acme"],
  }
}
```

While Aleph allows you to edit entities via the Aleph UI, you can also [read](/developers/how-to/data/export-ftm-data) and [write](/developers/how-to/data/import-ftm-data) entities programmatically in JSON format.
