# Where to find datasets

<p class="lead">Aleph allows you to find similar data across all investigations and datasets. This feature becomes more useful, if you have a basic set of data in your Aleph instance. This page lists some key open datasets that you can import into your Aleph instance.</p>

## Importing datasets

The datasets listed below can be downloaded in or easily converted to the FollowTheMoney format. Please refer to our guide on [importing FollowTheMoney data](/developers/how-to/data/import-ftm-data) for detailed instructions on how to import these datasets into your Aleph instance.
