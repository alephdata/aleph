# Developer tools

<p class="lead">
  Aleph as a toolkit contains a number of Python libraries that can be used independently of the core tool for data parsing and normalisation.
</p>

All of the tools below are packaged as releases regularly and can be installed via the Python package registry using `pip`:

[`fingerprints`](https://github.com/alephdata/fingerprints) is a Python library that heavily normalises names of companies and people before comparison. This includes transliteration, word order, and the normalisation of company type suffixes like Limited \(Ltd\) or Aktiengesellschaft \(AG\). `fingerprints` depends on `normality` and works best when `pyicu` is installed.

[`msglite`](https://github.com/alephdata/msglite) is a fork of `msg-extractor`, a parser for Microsoft Outlook MSG files. These binary email files are OLE containers \(like old-style Word or Excel documents\) and require some tickling before they will confess details about the contained email message.

[`countrynames`](https://github.com/alephdata/countrynames) helps to turn country names into two-letter ISO codes representing that country. For example, `United States` or `Delaware` become `us`, `England` becomes `gb`. Due to the work area of the OCCRP, this includes some exotic country designations, such as Yugoslavia, Transnistria and the Soviet Union \(now deceased\).

[`pantomime`](https://github.com/alephdata/pantomime) is a simple tool for dealing with MIME type names \(such as `text/plain`\). It contains both a parser and normaliser for MIME declarations, and many common types defined as constants.

[`languagecodes`](https://github.com/alephdata/languagecodes) is a Python library that handles the normalisation of language identifiers into ISO 3-letter codes. For example, `en` becomes `eng`, `de` becomes `deu`, etc.
