# alephclient CLI

<p class="lead">
  Python-based command line client and library for interacting with the Aleph API.
</p>

`alephclient` is a command-line client for Aleph. It can be used to bulk import document sets via the API, without direct access to the server.

## Installation

To install `alephclient`, you need to have Python 3 installed and working on your computer. You may also want to create a virtual environment using `virtualenv` or `pyenv`. With that done, type:

```bash
pip install alephclient
alephclient --help
```

## Configuration

`alephclient` needs to know the url of an Aleph instance that it will connect to. For privileged operations, it will also need to know the user's API key. The API key can be found in the users profile page on the Aleph web application.

Both settings can be provided by setting the environment variables `ALEPHCLIENT_HOST` and `ALEPHCLIENT_API_KEY` respectively; or by passing them in with `--host` and `--api-key` options directly for the command. The examples below will assume you have set up the environment variables:

```bash
export ALEPHCLIENT_HOST=https://data.occrp.org/
export ALEPHCLIENT_API_KEY=7b08118ad9e19be0a82906064ac9c19c8eee4869
```

Really enthusiastic users of Aleph might want to add these settings to their shell login file \(`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`\)

## Importing all files from a directory

The `crawldir` command crawls through a given directory recursively and uploads all the files and directories inside it to a collection. The external identifier \(foreign ID\) of the target collection needs to be passed to the command with `--foreign-id` option. If a collection with the given foreign ID does not exist, it will be created. The `path`argument needs to be a valid path to a file or directory:

```bash
alephclient crawldir --foreign-id wikileaks-cable /Users/sunu/data/cable
```

When Aleph imports data, it performs optical character recognition \(OCR\) on images contained in the material. This works better when Aleph already has an idea of the language the documents might use. This can be specified with the `--language` option, which expects a 3-letter ISO 639 language code. It can be specified multiple times, for when the directory contains files in more than one language.

```bash
alephclient crawldir --language rus --foreign-id russian_leak /Users/sunu/data/russian_leak
```

## Writing a stream of entities to a collection

Using the `write-entities` command, users can load JSON-formatted entities formatted in the `followthemoney` structure into an aleph collection. This can be used in conjunction with the [command-line tools for generating such data](/developers/followthemoney/ftm) provided by `followthemoney`. Data that is loaded this way should be aggregated before being written to the API, for example using the `ftm aggregate` command-line utility, or the `followthemoney-store` database layer.

A typical use might look this:

```bash
curl -o md_companies.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alephdata/aleph/master/mappings/md_companies.yml
ftm map md_companies.yml | ftm aggregate | alephclient write-entities -f md_companies
```

## **Streaming entities from a collection**

The command `stream-entities` is the inverse of `write-entities`. It will stream entities from the given Aleph instance so that they can be written to a file or piped into another processing step:

```bash
alephclient stream-entities -f us_ofac >us_ofac.json
```

With the [Follow the Money tools](/developers/followthemoney/ftm) installed, you can build more complex command like such:

```bash
alephclient stream-entities -f us_ofac | ftm validate | ftm export-excel -o OFAC.xlsx
```

<Callout theme="danger">
  Streaming very large collections from an Aleph instance is a resource-consuming activity on the server side. Please only stream collections with more than 100,000 entities after making sure that the server administrators are OK with it.
</Callout>

## Executing an entity mapping on the server

The `bulkload` command executes an [entity mapping](/developers/mappings) within the Aleph system. Its only argument is a YAML mapping file:

```
curl -o md_companies.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alephdata/aleph/master/mappings/md_companies.yml
alephclient bulkload md_companies.yml
```

<Callout>
  Using mappings within Aleph is falling out of use, we recommend generating and aggregating the entity stream outside the platform for a more reproducible and resumable data processing workflow.
