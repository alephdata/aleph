# Welcome

<p class="lead">
  Welcome to the documentation for Aleph, a suite of data analysis tools for
  investigators.
</p>

Aleph is a powerful tool for people who follow the money. It helps investigators to **securely access and search large amounts of data** - no matter whether they are a government database or a leaked email archive.

## Aleph for developers and admins

From a technical perspective, Aleph is a whole **suite of open source tools**. Besides running and configuring the Aleph server, the documentation also covers separate tools that are used to process data flexibly, interact with Aleph, or export data to another format.

## About the name

Aleph is named after a short story written by the Argentinian author Jorge Luis Borges, [The Aleph](http://www.phinnweb.org/links/literature/borges/aleph.html). It tells of a magical place that encapsulates all other places:

_Truth cannot penetrate a closed mind. If all places in the universe are in the Aleph, then all stars, all lamps, all sources of light are in it, too._
