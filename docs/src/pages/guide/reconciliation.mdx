# OpenRefine Reconciliation

<p class="lead">
  Aleph connects to OpenRefine, a free data processing tool, in order to perform
  batch lookups for a list of entities (e.g. people and companies).
</p>

**Entity reconciliation** can be used to check if any entry in a column of data mentions persons or companies of interest.

More generally, the function enables another application - typically [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org) - to link up (_reconcile_) values in it's own data with the entities stored in Aleph.

To use the reconciliation function, first install the free Open Refine tool on your computer and create a new project from a spreadsheet with at least one column that contains the names of people or companies.

In the header of that column, select the drop down menu, _Reconcile_, then _Start reconciling..._.

The following window allows you to add a new standard reconciliation service. Paste the URL for Aleph and click _Add Service_.

<Callout>
  It's recommended to run the reconciliation service against a specific dataset
  on Aleph, rather than a full site. The reconciliation URL for each dataset is
  shown on the dataset's overview page.

Then choose _Start reconciling_ to begin the reconciliation process.
