# Drawing network diagrams

<p class="lead">
  Over the course of an investigation, it is sometimes helpful to sketch out a network of involved parties so that you can understand who is linked to what.
</p>

**Network diagrams** let you illustrate webs of people, companies and other entities involved in an investigation in a visual diagram of actors and connections. It utilizes the same [types of nodes and connections](/developers/followthemoney/) as the rest of Aleph. It is important to note that all entities and relationships that you add to your diagram will be automatically added to the investigation in which the diagram is contained.

## Creating your first diagram

Network diagrams can be created within any [**investigation**](/guide/building-out-your-investigation/creating-an-investigation) you have access to in Aleph. To get started, click the "**Network diagrams**" button in the sidebar on any investigation page, and then the "**New diagram**" button.

You will now be able to map people, companies, and the relationships between them, which will be saved within your Aleph account, and only be visible to you and whomever you choose to share the diagram with.

## Adding entities to your diagram

To add people, companies, or other entities to your diagram, click the **"Add entities"** icon in the toolbar on the left side of the screen, or double click anywhere in the graphing area.

Once you have created multiple entities in your diagram, you can connect them by clicking the **"Add links"** icon.

Any entities and relationships you create within a diagram will automatically be added to the investigation in which your diagram was created. This allows you to cross-reference the lists of people, companies, and other entities you have created in your diagrams with data from across the rest of Aleph.

## Sharing diagrams

Once you have created a diagram, you can allow others to view or edit it by allowing them access to the investigation in which it is contained.

You can also export your diagram to be saved as a file on your computer by clicking the **"Export"** button in the top right corner of the diagram editor. Once the diagram has been exported as a file, it can be shared with others as with any other file on your computer.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Below are some of the common questions we've received about network diagrams. If you have another question or want to suggest an improvement, please [get in touch](/get-in-touch).

### How does this relate to OCCRP VIS?

[Visual Investigative Scenarios](https://vis.occrp.org/) (VIS) is an application developed by OCCRP, [RISE Project](https://www.riseproject.ro/) and [QuickData](http://www.quickdata.ro/) that is the inspiration for network diagrams. While it's been a beloved tool to some reporters, it has also become slow and cumbersome.

For this reason, we have made the difficult deicison to disable signups and the creation of new visualizations in VIS. Existing VIS diagrams stay accessible.

If youâ€™re looking for a visual mindmapping tool to use in you investigations, we recommend using network diagrams in Aleph instead.

### How much data can I add to a network diagram?

The goal of network diagrams in Aleph is to support investigative mind mapping, not big data analysis. While you may be able to add several hundred companies and people to a chart, the ideal size of a chart is somewhere around to 50-[150 entities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number).

### Can I make entities into groups?

Yes. Simply select two or more entities, then click the "Group selection" button, as depicted below.

### Can I embed a diagram in an article?

Yes. In main the toolbar, you have an option to export an SVG graphic to a file. This SVG can be opened and "beautified" in a program like Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape (open source), and eventually published to the web as an image.

Please be conscious, however, that network diagrams are mainly intended to be investigative sketches. Their complexity can easily exceed the complexity we should force our readers to deal with. Be nice to the mortals.

### Can I import a spreadsheet of names and companies into a diagram?

Yes! Follow the instructions for [generating multiple entities from a spreadsheet](/guide/building-out-your-investigation/generating-multiple-entities-from-a-list). In step 4 of the entity mapping process, select the desired destination diagram, and they will be automatically added to your diagram.
