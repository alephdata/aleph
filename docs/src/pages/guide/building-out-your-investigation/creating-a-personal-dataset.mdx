# Creating a personal dataset

<p class="lead">
  The start of any investigation in Aleph is a Personal dataset. Read below to find out how to create, manage, and share a workspace for your investigation.
</p>

Personal datasets are **contained workspaces** within Aleph where you can **upload**, **edit**, and **organize data** related to an investigation or topic of interest - and they can be shared with any other user or access group within Aleph.

While source datasets, like company registries and other evidentiary collections, cannot be edited, Personal datasets allow you to edit the contents by [uploading documents](/guide/building-out-your-investigation/uploading-documents), [mapping data into structured entities](/guide/building-out-your-investigation/generating-multiple-entities-from-a-list), and [creating your own network diagrams](/guide/building-out-your-investigation/network-diagrams).

To create a Personal dataset, click the "**Personal datasets"** button in the left sidebar on the homepage and then click the **"New dataset"** button.

## Managing Access to your Personal Dataset

When you create a Personal dataset, its contents are by default accessible to **you and no one else**. But access can easily be expanded to any co-collaborators you would like to include in your investigation.

To grant colleagues access to your dataset, click the **"Share"** button in the top right toolbar on your dataset's homepage.

The access control window will then appear, allowing you to share your Personal dataset with **other individuals** or **groups** you are a part of.

An individual must first have a user account on Aleph to receive access to a dataset. Sharing a dataset with a group means that any user in that group will receive the access you are granting.

- **View access** allows a user to browse the contents of a Personal dataset but not create, edit, or delete anything contained within
- **Edit access** allows a user full privileges to modify its contents

_Note: only Aleph administrators have the ability to make a Personal dataset publicly available._
