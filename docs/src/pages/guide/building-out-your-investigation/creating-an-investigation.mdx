# Creating an investigation

<p class="lead">
  Read below to find out how to create, manage, and share a workspace for your
  investigation.
</p>

Investigations are **contained workspaces** within Aleph where you can **upload**, **edit**, and **organize data** related to an investigation or topic of interest - and they can be shared with any other user or access group within Aleph.

While source datasets, like company registries and other evidentiary collections, cannot be edited, investigations allow you to edit the contents by [uploading documents](/guide/building-out-your-investigation/uploading-documents), [mapping data into structured entities](/guide/building-out-your-investigation/generating-multiple-entities-from-a-list), and [creating your own network diagrams](/guide/building-out-your-investigation/network-diagrams).

To create an investigation, click the "**Investigations"** button in the left sidebar on the homepage and then click the **"New investigation"** button.

## Managing access to your investigation

When you create an investigation, its contents are by default accessible to **you and no one else**. But access can easily be expanded to any co-collaborators you would like to include in your investigation.

To grant colleagues access to your investigation, click the settings button in the top right toolbar on your investigation homepage.

The access control window will then appear, allowing you to share your investigation with **other individuals** or **groups** you are a part of.

An individual must first have a user account on Aleph to receive access to an investigation. Sharing an investigation with a group means that any user in that group will receive the access you are granting.

- **View access** allows a user to browse the contents of an investigation but not create, edit, or delete anything contained within
- **Edit access** allows a user full privileges to modify its contents
