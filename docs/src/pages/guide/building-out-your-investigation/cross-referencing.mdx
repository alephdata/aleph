# Cross-referencing

<p class="lead">
  Aleph can conduct bulk searches to find all mentions of companies or people in
  one data source to those in all others. This can be a useful method to
  generate reporting leads.

Cross-referencing is a powerful means for reporters to do mass comparisons between persons of interest, public records and leaked data. See below for a tutorial presentation on the subject:
