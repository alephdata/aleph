# Managing Access

Investigation workspaces in OpenAleph are private by default, but you can choose to share them with trusted collaborators. Managing access allows you to control who can view or contribute to a workspace without compromising sensitive information.

## Default Privacy

When you create a new workspace, it is only visible to you. No one else can see or interact with its contents unless you explicitly invite them.

## Sharing a Workspace

To share a workspace with others:

1. Open the workspace.
2. Click the **Settings** or **Access** tab.
3. Enter the email address or username of the person you want to invite.

4. Assign a role:
	- **View**: Can see content, but cannot make changes.
	- **Edit**: Can upload documents, edit metadata, and contribute to the investigatio and add other users.
5. Click **Save changes**.

Invited users will see the workspace listed under their **Investigations** tab.

## Managing Existing Permissions

You can update or remove collaborators at any time under the investigations settings menu by clickin `Share`.
