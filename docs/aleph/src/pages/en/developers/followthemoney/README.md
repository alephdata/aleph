# Follow the Money

The [Follow the Money data model](https://followthemoney.readthedocs.io/en/latest/entity.html) is designed to organise concepts which arise in money laundering and corruption investigations in a way that is useful to investigative journalists.

Follow the Money is both the name of the data model, and of [a command-line tool used to generate and process data](ftm.md) formatted using this model. Aleph is an interactive viewer on top of a search index of Follow the Money entities.

_This page only provides a high-level overview of the data model. Check the_ [_reference documentation_](https://followthemoney.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) _for in-depth explanations._

## Schema

The data model of Follow the Money consists of so-called schemata, i.e. object types. They exist as an inheritance hierarchy, rooted in **things** and **intervals**. You can also think of these as entities and events.

### Things

Things describe most of the real-world objects represented in Aleph and Follow the Money. This includes `People` and `Companies`, `Assets` and `Court Cases`. While normally generated by the file ingestion service of the Aleph server, a large set of sub-types of `Document`is creating through [entity mappings](../mappings.md).

![Things \(or nodes\) include People, Companies, Documents and similar entity types.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vRxZCCukFrO6I2S6Hz-nQytTrEqFzUSeWapCMYcdORgYfZsKCc4FZ1JzWbBLXU2mxI_wlaxBJ1SSEp1/pub?w=2784&amp;h=1061)

### Intervals

Intervals are business interests, court cases, sanctions and transactions \(and their descendents\). Intervals tend to be useful for linking two entities together, possibly over a specific time period.

![Intervals are temporary in nature, and often define a relationship between two or more things, e.g. a membership in an organisation, or a family association.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vR9vlUEfPC_zuymx0HMI2IHpViJC-c0BQI5zTlvJKFxP-z50McU5N6LPaXWMH2EHN6Nr1WJC-t561OR/pub?w=2526&amp;h=1006)

### Linked data

Follow the Money is reminiscent of a linked data ontology, and indeed it is regularly published in [Turtle](https://alephdata.github.io/followthemoney/ns/ftm.ttl) and [RDF/XML](https://alephdata.github.io/followthemoney/ns/ftm.xml) format for use in RDF-based applications. See the `ftm export-rdf` [documentation](ftm.md#exporting-entities-to-rdf-linked-data) for help on how to export Follow the Money data to linked data.

In conjunction, you can use the RDF-based ontology version that is generated [here](https://alephdata.github.io/followthemoney/ns/ftm.xml). It can be used to drive interactive data explorers in multiple formats, including:

* The [LODE documentation browser](http://150.146.207.114/lode/extract?url=https%3A%2F%2Falephdata.github.io%2Ffollowthemoney%2Fns%2Fftm.xml&owlapi=true&imported=true&lang=en) \(great for reading\)
* A [network visualisation of the ontology](http://www.visualdataweb.de/webvowl/#iri=https://alephdata.github.io/followthemoney/ns/ftm.xml) provided by WebVOWL.

## Proposing changes

Any user of Aleph should feel free to propose changes or extensions to the Follow the Money data model by [submitting a GitHub issue](https://github.com/alephdata/followthemoney/issues). Proposed changes should embody the design sense of the data model, which prioritises practicality over correctness; understandability over standards compliance.
