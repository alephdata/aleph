President Trump on Wednesday praised his just-convicted former campaign chairman for refusing to “break” and cooperate with federal prosecutors investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, expressing appreciation for the personal loyalty of a felon found guilty of defrauding the United States government.
In a series of tweets the morning after an extraordinary day in which Paul Manafort, his former campaign chief, was convicted of tax and bank fraud and his longtime personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations he said were directed by Mr. Trump, the president appeared to suggest he was more concerned with the fallout for himself than with the crimes.
He compared Mr. Cohen unfavorably with Mr. Manafort, attacking Mr. Cohen as a bad lawyer who had caved to pressure from biased federal prosecutors while lauding Mr. Manafort as a “brave man” with a “wonderful family” who had stood strong.
“‘Justice’ took a 12 year old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him and, unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to ‘break’ — make up stories in order to get a ‘deal,’” Mr. Trump wrote, his quotation marks suggesting his disdain for the Justice Department.
The president played down the wrongdoing by both men, noting that the jury in Mr. Manafort’s case convicted him of eight counts of fraud but did not reach a conclusion on 10 other charges.
“Witch Hunt!” Mr. Trump proclaimed.
He was harsher on Mr. Cohen, writing that if anybody wanted a good lawyer, he “would strongly suggest” not hiring him. But the president also claimed falsely that the felonies to which Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty were, in fact, “not a crime.”
At the White House, the mood was somber as aides struggled to come to grips with news that raised profound questions about Mr. Trump and the future of his presidency, including whether he had lied to the American public, whether he would be impeached and whether he considered himself above the law.
Pressed on those issues by reporters at a news briefing on Wednesday afternoon, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, insisted there was no crisis afoot in the West Wing. She said neither Mr. Manafort’s conviction nor Mr. Cohen’s guilty plea had anything to do with Mr. Trump, and they did not have any bearing on him.
“The president has done nothing wrong,” Ms. Sanders said during the unusually subdued question-and-answer session. “There are no charges against him. There is no collusion.”
Grim-faced as she fielded a variety of questions about Mr. Manafort and Mr. Cohen and the implications of their misdeeds for the president, Ms. Sanders recited the three-part denial again and again, as if to will the issue away.
