<span id="title">How to search with Aleph</span>

<p>
  Aleph stores a large number of documents from a variety of sources.
  In order to find the exact material you need, you may want to make
  use of some of it's advanced search operators.
</p>

<h3>Advanced Search Operators</h3>

<p>
  To find <strong>exact matches</strong> for a given search term, e.g.
  to search for a person or company, try putting the name in quotes:
</p>

<pre>"Barack Obama"</pre>

<h4>Proximity Searches</h4>

<p>
  If you do not want to find a precise string, but merely specify that
  two words are supposed to appear close to each other, you might want
  to use <strong>proximity search</strong>. This will try to find all
  the requested search terms within a given distance from each other:
</p>

<pre>"Bank America"~2</pre>

<p>
  This will find relevant matches with the terms "Bank" and "America"
  occuring within two words from each other, such as "Bank of America",
  "Bank in America", even "America has a Bank".
</p>

<h4>Spelling Errors</h4>

<p>
  The same principle of proximity can also be applied inside of 
  individual words. A search will then try to find not just the
  precise word you've specified, but also <strong>spelling variants</strong>.
  A spelling variant is defined by the number of spelling mistakes
  that must be made to get from the original word to the variant.
</p>

<pre>Wladimir~2</pre>

<p>
  This will find not just the term "Wladimir", but also similar words
  such as "Vladimir", "Wladimyr" or "Vladimyr". Note that if you set the
  permissible distance too high, you will get very slow searches and
  many false results.
</p>

<h4>Composite queries</h4>

<p>
  You can make queries composed of multiple terms in various ways. The
  simplest form is to just put more than one word into the search bar.
  In this case, Aleph will try and find documents that contain all of
  the given terms and put these first. After that, results that miss any
  of the given search terms will also be shown.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to make sure that a given term must show up in the results 
  (or may never show up), you can put a plus sign ("+") in front of it 
  (or a minus sign, "-", to make sure all documents with the given word
  are removed).
</p>

<pre>banana -ice -cream +fruit</pre>

<p>
  You can also make more complex, boolean queries in which the terms "OR"
  and "AND" are used to specify the that certain search terms must appear
  together (or can serve as alternatives to each other).
</p>

<pre>banana AND ("ice cream" OR gelato)</pre>
