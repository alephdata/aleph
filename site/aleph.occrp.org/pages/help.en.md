We’ve written a short [user guide](https://docs.aleph.occrp.org/users/) that should help you to get started.

* For any questions **about the platform and the data we publish**, please [contact us](https://requests.occrp.org/datadesk).  We’re also happy to set up a walk-through of the platform for new users.
* If you're looking for **support with your investigative work**, file a request with the research service at [OCCRP ID](https://id.occrp.org/).
* If you're having issues signing in to **your user account**, [message OCCRP's tech support](https://requests.occrp.org/helpdesk)

Please note that this is a service intended for the use of **professional journalists** and some activists. We are unable to provide support to people working in other fields.
