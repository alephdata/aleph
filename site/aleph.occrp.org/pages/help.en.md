We’ve written a short [handbook for the platform](https://docs.alephdata.org/guide/getting-started) that should help you to get started.

* For any questions **about the platform and the data we publish**, please contact [data@occrp.org](mailto:data@occrp.org) (GPG: `D4FA FD4E`).  We’re also happy to set up a walk-through of the platform for new users.
* If you're looking for **support with your investigative work**, file a request with the research service at [OCCRP ID](https://id.occrp.org/).
* If you're having issues signing in to **your user account**, e-mail [tech@occrp.org](mailto:tech@occrp.org) (GPG: `5500 A59A`)

Please note that this is a service intended for the use of **professional journalists** and some activists. We are unable to provide support to people working in other fields.
