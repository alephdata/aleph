OCCRP Aleph is an investigative data platform that helps reporters **follow the money**. We provide public access to a vast archive of government records and open databases. However, much of the Aleph archive is protected from public access due to concerns about data protection. OCCRP grants access to journalists and activists on a case by case basis (see below).

Aleph is more than just a document search engine: it also imports structured data from spreadsheets and databases, enabling journalists to explore detailed data about persons of interest, companies, financial transactions, and more. Reporters and researchers can upload their own files to private investigations, extract text, sketch a diagram, to summarize their investigative findings, and cross-reference persons of interest and companies.

### What data is in Aleph?

Aleph contains material from a [wide range of sources](/datasets). Weâ€™re focused on collecting data that will help us track assets and corporate ownership, government expenditure, and information on individuals and groups that are of journalistic interest. We also import leaked archives and corporate data with journalistic relevance.

Our geographic focus is on Central and Eastern Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, South America, and various offshore jurisdictions. The archive is built in tandem with our stories. Often, we scrape or index material related to ongoing investigations.
