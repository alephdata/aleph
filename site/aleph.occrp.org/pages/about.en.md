OCCRP Aleph is an investigative data platform that helps reporters **follow the money**. We provide public access to a vast archive of government records and open databases. Much of the Aleph archive is protected from public access due to concerns about data protection and civil rights. OCCRP may grant access to journalists, activists or academia after an individual application (see below).

Reporters can also upload their own files to private investigations, extract text, sketch a diagram to summarize their investigative findings, and cross-reference persons of interest. Aleph is more than just a document search engine: it also imports structured data from spreadsheets and databases, enabling journalists to express detailed data about persons of interest, companies, financial transactions, and more.

### What data is in Aleph?

Aleph contains material from a [wide range of sources](/datasets). We’re focused on collecting data that will help us track assets and corporate ownership, government expenditure, and information on individuals and groups of journalistic interest. We also import leaked archives and corporate data with journalistic relevance. 

Our geographic focus is on Central and Eastern Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, South America, and various offshore jurisdictions. The archive is built in tandem with our stories. Often, we scrape or index material related to ongoing investigations.
