### Can I submit documents that I want OCCRP to investigate?

Aleph is not a whistleblowing platform. Please see OCCRP’s [Becoming a Whistleblower](https://www.occrp.org/en/become-a-whistleblower/) page if you have documents that you want to share with our reporters.

### How up-to-date is the data?

This varies from dataset to dataset. While some sources are static, we run more than 200 scrapers to update official datasets on a weekly or monthly basis. Datasets that are updated automatically will show the update frequency in the dataset description.

### Can I add my own data to OCCRP Aleph?

If you are granted access to Aleph as a journalist, you’re welcome to create an investigation and upload documents and/or create your own data, such as lists of persons of interest. Aleph helps you to systematize your own research, share it with colleagues, and cross-reference lists of people with our archive. You can also use Aleph as a text recognition (OCR) tool for scanned documents.

The data you upload will be visible only to some members of OCCRP’s data team, but no other editorial staff. This enables us to provide service support, either to process or analyze the data on request. In some cases, the data team may offer to introduce you to journalists who are developing related stories.

If you are an open data activist and have collected datasets that should be included in Aleph, please [contact us](https://requests.occrp.org/datadesk) so that we can work together to import the data. Contributing your data will put it at the fingertips of hundreds of investigative reporters.

### Can I ask for a dataset to be scraped and added to Aleph?

We welcome suggestions for scrapers that should be added to Aleph. We prioritize resources that would help our reporters track organized crime and corruption in their investigations. In particular, this includes databases of beneficial ownership of companies, real estate, and financial payments by governments to the private sector.

Please file a request with [OCCRP ID](https://id.occrp.org) to suggest a dataset.

### Can I use the Aleph software for my own project?

Yes! The original core version of Aleph is open source and can still be installed and operated independently. Please visit the [Aleph Technical Documentation](https://docs.aleph.occrp.org/developers/) page for setup and usage instructions.

Please note that maintenance of the open-source version will end after October 2025, as we transition to Aleph Pro, our new supported platform.

### What is Aleph Pro?

Aleph Pro is the next iteration of OCCRP’s investigative data platform. It is a hosted, secure, and scalable version of Aleph, built to support modern investigations while removing the technical burden of self-hosting. Aleph Pro delivers enhanced performance, powerful new features, and tailored support across a range of access tiers.

### What’s happening to the public Aleph instance?

Nothing is changing. The public instance of Aleph at [aleph.occrp.org] will be free and accessible to journalists, researchers, and the public. In the next few months, the technology underlying this instance will be migrated to the new Aleph Pro stack, which will mean a few new features, better performance, greater stability and better data ingestion. It will also allow OCCRP to make significant cost savings on the costs of running this instance. Most of these changes will be under-the-hood and you will still be able to use Aleph as you always have to explore datasets and find leads for your investigations.

### We currently operate our own Aleph instance. What does this mean for us?

Self-hosted Aleph instances will gradually transition to Aleph Pro. OCCRP will support this process, providing clear migration paths, hands-on assistance, and flexible deployment options — including private cloud and on-premise installations.

### Can I use the Aleph API?

Aleph provides an extensive REST API that can be used to query its knowledge graph. This is available to the public, but rate limits apply for non-registered users.

The API, like the rest of our platform, is intended to be used by journalists. We reserve the option to terminate any use that puts an undue burden on our infrastructure.

Using the Aleph API is not a valid approach to “know your customer” (KYC) checks required for regulated industries, and it does not mean that your customers are “vetted by OCCRP.” Our reporting has repeatedly shown the need for KYC to be done responsibly, and we reserve the right to contact a financial regulator if we find API clients doing this.

### How do I get access to bulk data?

A number of datasets that are available in OCCRP’s Aleph instance can also be downloaded in the FollowTheMoney format. Please check out the [Aleph Technical Documentation](https://docs.aleph.occrp.org/developers/getting-started/find-datasets/) for more information.

It is our policy not to provide bulk exports to non-journalists. This specifically includes banks, due diligence firms, and machine learning researchers.
