To ensure that disputes are dealt with soon after they arise, you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action you might have arising out of or related to use of our services or these terms of use must be filed within the applicable statute of limitations or, if earlier, one (1) year after the pertinent facts underlying such claim or cause of action could have been discovered with reasonable diligence.

These terms of use do not create an employment, agency, partnership, or joint venture relationship between you and us, OCCRP. If you have not signed a separate agreement with us, these terms of use (and the other documents referred to in them) are the entire agreement between you and us. If there is any conflict between these terms of use and a signed written agreement between you and us, the signed agreement will control our relationship with you.

If in any circumstance, we do not apply or enforce any provision of these terms of use, it is not a waiver of that provision.

You understand that, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by us, you have no expectation of compensation for any activity, contribution, or idea that you provide to us, or Aleph. 

If any provision or part of a provision of these terms of use is found unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these terms of use and will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and all other provisions of these terms of use will remain in full force and effect.
